            FramerFlow is a simple editor to help you creating beautiful
            prototypes. Prototyping is a sort of proactive exploration to
            undiscovered things.
            That is one of the reasons why, we believe, prototyping has a tremendous fun.
            We want to make it more enjoyable and manageable.
            That's why we have created <b>FramerFlow</b>.

                We have some plans to bring cutting-edge exploration tools
                in coming releases.
                Please keep eyes on FramerFlow.
